What DINGOS is still missing
============================

At the current revision: **LOT'S**. Currently, Dingos support import and viewing/search of the imported data,
but of course it also requires facilities for editing, authorization management etc., etc., etc.

If there are features you particularly miss and feel like contributing, please have a look at
:doc:`contributing` and  :doc:`developers_guide`.
