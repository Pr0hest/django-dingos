Before starting to develop
==========================


Django DINGOS profitted a lot from the advice provided in `Two Scoops of Django`_.

Unless you are an absolute Django expert (and maybe even then), please
read Daniel Greenfield's and Audrey Roy's excellent `Two Scoops of Django`_.
Even though it provides best practices for Django 1.5, most of its
advice is also valid for Django 1.6, and likely to be very relevant
for quite a few minor revisions to come.
